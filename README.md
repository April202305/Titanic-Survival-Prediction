## Key Features

### Model Training (`Train/`)
- **Two Implementations**  
  - `decision_tree.py`: Decision Tree classifier with hyperparameter tuning
  - `logistic_regression.py`: Logistic Regression model with feature normalization
- **Unified Notebook** (`train.ipynb`):  
  Combines both models with interactive visualizations and comparative analysis

### Data Analysis (`Analysis/`)
- **Pre-analysis-EDA.ipynb**:  
  - Missing value handling
  - Feature distributions
  - Survival correlations (age/class/gender)
- **Result-analysis.ipynb**:  
  - Feature importance visualization
  - Model accuracy metrics

## Installation

1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/April202305/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter for analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

### Training Models
```bash
# Run Decision Tree
python Train/decision_tree.py

# Run Logistic Regression
python Train/logistic_regression.py
```

### Interactive Exploration
1. Open `train.ipynb` for model comparison
2. Execute cells to regenerate results
